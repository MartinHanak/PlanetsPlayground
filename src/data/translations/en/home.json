  "secondParTitle": "NASA data",
  "secondParContent": " We cannot start the simulation if we do not know where the planets are, how far they are from each other and how fast they move. To get all of this simulation we can make use of NASA data provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Horizons API. Once we have the initial coordinates and velocities, we can finally start the simulation. ",
  "thirdParTitle": "Guaranteed precision",
  "thirdParContent": "Newton's equations of motion are solved by employing the Velocity Verlet integrator. Complicated differential equations describing the N-body problem are thus approximated using a finite timestep. Every timestep involves calculating forces between all of the N bodies in the simulation and updating their position and velocity. "
